## 1. Executive thesis

<img src="assets/stackglass-horizontal.svg" alt="Stackglass" width="420"/> <p align="center"><strong>See what your project is actually doing.</strong></p> <p align="center">Developer observability and verification for Cursor.</p>

**Why a buyer cares:** stackglass packages transferable product IP â€” source, docs, in-repo brand assets, and a diligence room under `docs/acquisition/` â€” under a clear proprietary posture so diligence can proceed without mistaking the repo for open source.

## 2. Product snapshot

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Product | stackglass |
| Repo | `theworker02/stackglass` |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Open source? | **No** â€” proprietary |
| Rightsholder | theworker02 |
| Diligence pack | `docs/acquisition/` |

### Capability highlights (from current materials)

- **GlassCore** workspace runtime, config, process execution, permissions, logging
- **GlassIndex** files, packages, tests, imports, public exports
- **GlassTrace** development timeline
- **GlassWatch** classified file events; optional `watch.autoRun` related tests
- **GlassLab** discovery, plans, runs, flakes, coverage, mutation, contracts
- **GlassLens** narrative, session replay, heat, clusters, snapshot compare, suspicious commits
- **22 MCP tools** plus resources and prompts (new capability is optional args, never a 23rd tool)
- **CLI** `glass` / `stackglass`
- **Cursor plugin** rules, skills, agents, commands, hooks
- **Local dashboard** `glass dashboard` with live Why / Session / Heat / Clusters views

## 3. Problem / opportunity

Teams evaluating stackglass typically need either (a) a commercial right to run or embed it, or (b) outright ownership of the Product IP for strategic build-out. Public GitHub visibility without a proprietary license creates false assumptions about free production use. This brief and the linked data room make the commercial path explicit.

---

## 4. What ships today

Honest maturity: treat repository contents, README claims, tests, and release tags as the source of truth. Do not assume production customers, ARR, filed patents, or SLAs unless separately evidenced in diligence.

Typical transferable surfaces:

- Source tree and build/test scripts present in-repo
- Documentation and design notes
- Acquisition / diligence markdown under `docs/acquisition/`
- Branding assets committed to the repository (if any)

## 5. Demo / evaluation path (buyer)

Minimal path (no secrets required unless README says otherwise):

```
```text
Developer flight recorder
+ Testing laboratory (GlassLab)
+ Change inspector
+ Debugging assistant
+ Project status console
+ MCP server
+ Cursor agent toolkit
+ GlassLens (narrative, session, heat, clusters)
```
```text
token.ts edited Ã¢â€ â€™ typecheck fails Ã¢â€ â€™ two auth tests fail Ã¢â€ â€™ contract drifts Ã¢â€ â€™ README example goes stale
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theworker02/stackglass.git
cd stackglass
npm install
npm run build
node cli/dist/bin.js --help
```
```bash
node /path/to/stackglass/cli/dist/bin.js init
```
```bash
cd your-project
glass init
glass status
glass why
glass test related
glass dashboard
```
```bash
glass test related
glass test changed
glass test failed
glass test flakes
glass test repeat 5
glass test mutation src/auth/token.ts
glass test coverage
glass test contracts
```

Extended evaluation: `docs/acquisition/BUYER_EVALUATION.md`. Written NDA / evaluation grants may be required for private materials.

## 6. What a transaction typically includes

Subject to definitive schedules:

| Included (typical) | Excluded (typical) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Repo materials + asserted original IP | Seller personal accounts / unrelated repos |
| Docs + diligence room at closing | Third-party dependency source under separate licenses |
| In-repo brand marks as assigned | Secrets without rotation plan |
| Know-how captured in docs | Fabricated revenue, user, or adoption metrics |

---

## 7. Suggested deal structures

| Structure | When it fits |
|-----------|--------------|
| Non-exclusive commercial license | Deploy/run under seat or environment terms |
| Exclusive field-of-use license | Buyer wants exclusivity; seller may retain entity |
| Asset / IP assignment | Buyer wants ownership of Materials outright |
| OEM / redistribution | Separate agreement â€” not implied here |

Commercial terms (price, earnouts, escrow) are negotiated under NDA with counsel.

## 8. Buyer diligence checklist

- [ ] Confirm Rightsholder identity and authority to sell/license
- [ ] Inventory Materials (`docs/acquisition/ASSET_INVENTORY.md`)
- [ ] Review IP posture (`IP_PROVENANCE.md`) and dependencies (`DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.md`)
- [ ] Run evaluation script (`BUYER_EVALUATION.md`)
- [ ] Review risks (`RISK_REGISTER.md`)
- [ ] Agree transfer scope (`TRANSFER_MANIFEST.md`) and handoff (`HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md`)
- [ ] Supersede root `LICENSE` at closing via definitive agreement
